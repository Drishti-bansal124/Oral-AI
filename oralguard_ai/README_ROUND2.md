### (**MANDATORY: What Will Be Added in Round 2**)

# Planned Improvements — Round 2 Development

Round 2 focuses on **scaling the prototype into a clinically stronger, more robust system**.

---

## 🔮 Planned Enhancements

### 1️⃣ Expanded Dataset
- Add **real premalignant lesions** (leukoplakia, erythroplakia)
- Increase dataset size to **50–100+ images per class**
- Include multi-source clinical data

---

### 2️⃣ Cancer Stage Prediction
- Extend model to predict:
  - Early stage
  - Advanced stage
- Multi-head neural network architecture

---

### 3️⃣ Histopathology Integration
- Add biopsy image analysis
- Patch-based CNN for slide-level inference
- Dual-model system:
  - Clinical image model
  - Histopathology model

---

### 4️⃣ Frontend Web Application
- Clean UI for image upload
- Visual confidence meter
- Result explanation panel

---

### 5️⃣ Explainable AI (XAI)
- Grad-CAM visual heatmaps
- Highlight suspicious regions in oral images
- Improve clinical trust

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment & Scalability
- Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP)
- Dockerized backend
- API-based integration with telemedicine platforms

---

## 🎯 Vision for Round 2

To transform OralGuard AI from a **screening prototype** into a **clinically assistive, scalable AI healthcare platform**.
