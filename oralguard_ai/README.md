# OralGuard AI — Advanced Oral Cancer Detection System

OralGuard AI is an AI-powered healthcare screening system designed to assist in the **early detection of oral cancer** using clinical oral images. The system classifies images into **Normal, Premalignant, and Malignant** categories, enabling faster screening and improved accessibility, especially in resource-limited settings.
